## Provisioning and Deployment

#### 1- As a student I want basic knowledge of how to set up and deploy different server configurations as local virtual machines so that I can test them.
#### 2- As a student I want basic knowledge of how to set up and deploy different server configurations with a cloud provider so that I can seamlessly move         between local, test, and production environments.
#### 3- As a developer I want to have a machine configuration locally accessible which is configured as closely as possible as the production environment           so that I can test and mess up locally.
#### 4- As a manager I want my developers to be able to test locally in a cheap way so that overall costs are kept down.
